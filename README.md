# The basket

The Basket is a game made for the Extra Credits game jam, where the theme was "Take Care", with an artstyle inspired from Kurzgesagt. This game, there was an invasion of 120 total birds all going for a basket full of food. You, the protector of the basket has to drive away as many of these cute, squishy birds as possible.
